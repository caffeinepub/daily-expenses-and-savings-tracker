# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the Dashboard and Entries pages mobile-first responsive and comfortable to use on phone screens.

**Planned changes:**
- Update Dashboard layout for small viewports (≈320–430px) to avoid horizontal scrolling, reduce desktop-oriented spacing, and scale typography appropriately.
- Improve mobile header/navigation behavior so navigation remains accessible, indicates the active page, and does not overlap or overflow content.
- Adapt the Entries list for mobile by replacing the cramped table presentation with a mobile-friendly layout (e.g., stacked rows/cards) while keeping filters and edit/delete actions touch-friendly.

**User-visible outcome:** On phones, the Dashboard and Entries pages fit the screen without horizontal scrolling, navigation is reliably usable, and entries are easy to browse, filter, edit, and delete with touch-friendly controls.
