  "summary": "Diff adds an Android wrapper project (Capacitor-based) under frontend/android and a new build guide file, but the provided documentation appears truncated/incomplete in the diff summary and many unrelated frontend UI changes were also introduced that were not requested by REQ-13.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-13",
      "requirement": "Add a README (or clearly named documentation file) with step-by-step instructions to generate a debug APK locally, including prerequisites, install commands, and the output path/name of the generated APK.",
      "reason": "The added documentation file shown in the diff is truncated and stops at the beginning of the Capacitor CLI section, so the required step-by-step build commands, install commands, and the exact debug APK output path/name are not evidenced in the provided diff summary.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-13",
      "requirement": "No backend canister changes are required (APK uses the same deployed canister endpoints as the web build).",
      "reason": "The diff summary does not provide evidence about canister endpoint configuration (e.g., environment variables, network config) or explicitly state that the Android wrapper points to the same deployed endpoints; only Android wrapper files are shown.",
