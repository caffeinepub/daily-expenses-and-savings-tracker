  "summary": "Diff implements improved frontend error normalization/toasts for entry creation and adds React Query invalidation/refetch so Entries and Dashboard update after saving. Backend shows a role assignment on registerUser, but there’s no clear evidence of automatic/robust user-role initialization for all authenticated callers across the required endpoints.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-42",
      "requirement": "Update backend access control initialization so authenticated users are reliably granted the required 'user' permissions to use core app functionality without needing an admin secret token.",
      "reason": "The diff only shows role assignment during registerUser; it does not show any initialization/auto-assignment path ensuring a newly signed-in principal can call getCallerUserProfile, saveCallerUserProfile, addOrUpdateEntry, getEntries, and getDashboard without hitting authorization traps due to missing role initialization. No migration/init logic beyond registerUser is evidenced.",
      "evidence": [
        "backend/main.mo (shows `registerUser` assigning `#user`, but no broader initialization is shown)"
      ]

    {
      "description": "Added an Entries page UI toggle to show/hide the entry form (shown by default).",
      "reason": "REQ-41/42/43 focus on fixing add-entry flow, backend authorization init, and error reporting; a show/hide form toggle is not requested and is a UI/UX change beyond what’s strictly required.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/pages/EntriesPage.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Made category selection mandatory with new validation errors (e.g., 'Please select a category') and category clearing logic based on entry type.",
      "reason": "The request is about fixing add-entry authorization + error reporting; this introduces new validation/behavior not explicitly requested and may change prior behavior.",
