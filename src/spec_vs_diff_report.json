  "summary": "The diff primarily implements mobile-first responsiveness across Dashboard and Entries, adds a dedicated mobile entries card list with edit/delete actions, improves responsive spacing/typography, and updates the header to a sticky, full-width mobile navigation with clear active-state indication. One unrequested change appears to be the addition of a branded footer/link in the main layout.",

      "description": "Added/introduced a global footer with a \"Built with ❤️ using caffeine.ai\" outbound link in the main layout.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest focuses on mobile responsiveness/navigation and entries mobile layout; it does not request adding new branding/footer content or external referral links.",
