  "summary": "REQ-24 is implemented via new EXPENSE_CATEGORIES and SAVING_CATEGORIES constants and used by Add/Edit flows. REQ-25/26 appear largely implemented (type-specific category lists, clearing invalid category on type change, and blocking submit/save when category missing), but the diff is truncated so required field labeling (“Category *”) and any in-form validation text can’t be fully verified. REQ-27 is partially addressed (theme tokens and stronger overlays for readability), but the diff does not provide evidence that all explicit black text styling (e.g., text-black / #000) has been eliminated across the UI.",

      "id": "REQ-25",
      "requirement": "Update the Add New Entry form so Category is mandatory with clear English required labeling (e.g., “Category *”) and validation feedback when missing.",
      "reason": "While submission is blocked with an English toast error (“Please select a category”), the diff for EntryForm.tsx is truncated before the Category field UI, so it’s not possible to confirm the label text includes “Category *” or that the category field itself is visually marked required.",

      "requirement": "Update the Edit Entry dialog so Category is mandatory with clear English required labeling (e.g., “Category *”) and block saving until a valid category is selected.",
      "reason": "Blocking save appears implemented via toast error when category is empty, but the diff is truncated before the Category field rendering, so it’s not possible to confirm the required label (“Category *”) or exact UI validation messaging in the dialog content.",

      "requirement": "Remove black-colored text from the UI by eliminating explicit black text styling (e.g., `text-black`, inline `#000`, or equivalent) and ensure text colors consistently use theme-driven tokens across pages and dialogs.",
      "reason": "The diff shows theme variable updates and higher-opacity overlays for readability, but it does not show removal of explicit black text classes/values across the codebase. Without evidence of changes in other components/pages, compliance with “no explicit black text styling anywhere” cannot be verified.",
